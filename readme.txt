The purpose of this project is to provide security researchers with a simple, affordable means to test their LAN by having an implant dial out to C2 as soon as the device is plugged in.

This can be done with any Raspberry Pi device, and it is recommended to install Kali OS for the sake of convenience. This script is created under the assumption that you have already connected to your RPi via SSH and currently have an active session so that configuring the RPi will take place after the C2 instance is spun up in AWS and the IP is fetched. 

Terraform will create an SSH key with C2 being configured to hold the public key, and the implant will hold the private key. If the connection between the implant and C2 is broken, it will continue attempting to re-connect every five minutes until a connection is made or the implant is shut down.
